# My-Python-Journey
This is where I begin my Python Journey. This is the first step to a journey of a thousand miles that has been created by God.
Here, I am going to be working on 100 python projects in 100 days, this will not only show my expertise in the language but will also show that I am consistent and goal-oriented and I do not make excuses because there is not going to be a day I will skip.

## We finally move men

It has been a while but I think I have finally gotten a hang of it
